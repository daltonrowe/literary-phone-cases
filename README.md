# Literary Phone Cases Gatsby + Netlify CMS site

Used to display some phone cases I made one time, an experiment with using GraphQL, React, and Netlify CDS. It was/is a pleasure :)

## Points to Expand
- Netlify Identity Integration
- Netlify CMS Admin (Static vs Gatsby page)
- Netlify Form Submission
- Gatsby Special Files (As a First Timer)

## Future Improvements
- Another design pass
- Handle form close/open behavior in `src/components/ContactForm.js` through React modals
- Add Thank you illustration and popover
- Add filter search (with suggestions?)
- Lazy load images
- Credit relevant repos

This is ending up as a remake of https://github.com/erquhart/gatsby-netlify-cms-example
but of course I'm learning things the hard way :)
