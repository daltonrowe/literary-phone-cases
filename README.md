# Literary Phone Cases Gatsby + Netlify CMS site

Used to display some phone cases I made one time, an experiment with using GraphQL, React, and Netlify CDS. It was/is a pleasure :)

## Future Improvements
- Expand this README
- Another design pass
- Handle link behavior in `src/components/ContactForm.js` through React
- Add filter search (with suggestions?)
- Lazy load images

This is ending up as a remake of https://github.com/erquhart/gatsby-netlify-cms-example
but of course I'm learning things the hard way :)
